Key Features:
Remote Monitoring via GSM

Send temperature and humidity updates via SMS to a predefined number.
Can trigger alerts when temperature/humidity crosses predefined thresholds.
GPRS Connectivity (Optional)

Send data to a remote server, cloud (AWS, Thingspeak, Firebase), or IoT platform via HTTP/MQTT.
Enable real-time monitoring through dashboards like Grafana.
Low Power Consumption

SIM900 has power-saving modes.
Can operate on battery/solar for remote applications.
DHT11 Sensor Features

Simple one-wire communication with microcontroller.
Microcontroller Integration

Can be used with Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, Raspberry Pi for data processing.
Uses UART (SIM900) and Digital Pin (DHT11) for communication.
Two-Way Communication

User can send an SMS command (e.g., "TEMP?") and receive real-time temperature & humidity data.
Data Logging & Storage

Store sensor readings on an SD card or cloud database for future analysis.
Alert & Notification System

SMS/Call alerts on temperature/humidity threshold breaches.
Can integrate with buzzer/relay for local alerts.
Customizable Automation

Control devices (fans, heaters) based on sensor values using relay modules.
Rugged & Reliable for Remote Applications

Suitable for agriculture, industrial monitoring, cold storage, smart homes, etc.
